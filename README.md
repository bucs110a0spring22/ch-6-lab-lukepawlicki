## SUMMARY:
 This program takes a user-inputted value of n and puts it into the sequence 3n+1. If the value is positive, it is halved; if the value is odd, it is put into the sequence. The function returns the number of iterations it takes to get to 1. The graph function graphs the value for n on the x-axis and the number of iterations to get to 1 on the y-axis. A second turtle is used to keep track of the maximum so far in the top left of the screen.
